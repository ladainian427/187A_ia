        <p>Taking those options we looked at what sites we liked the best. We liked the simplicity that NYU, RISD, and MIT offered us, so we tried to recreate their navigation. We saw that many of them had common options, so we took those options first, then looked at to see if any of them were too broad or too specific. We took those main elements, combined a few and separated others to come up with our navigation.</p>
        <p>We decided to have About, Academics, Admissions, Research, and Athletics.</p>
			<p>We did the same process for the sub menus in each primary navigation element. These were the About options available on every site. </p>

		<p>Looking at the About pages, we thought that RISD tried to have too many elements,
		 while MIT didn't have enough. We liked the amount of information that GIT was able 
		 to contain was a lot better than RISD so our submenu tabs were based on the GIT about
		  page.

 <p>We saw the Admissions page on UCLA and did not like it at all,
  so we wanted to make sure we avoided the same mistake of having 
  that many elements on their sub-menu. MIT, GIT, and RISD had 
  minimal elements while retaining enough information to navigate.
   NYU had a few extraneous elements that we thought were unnecessary,
    but the menus we saw regarding admissions were generally good so 
    we tried to keep it simple. 
 </p>
 
 <p>Taking our analysis of those sites, we came up with these 
 following options for our choices. We also saw that sites like 
 NYU and GIT had a navbar pushed all the way to the top of the 
 page for Prospective students, current students, and other people.
  We decided that this was a navigation tool we also wanted so we put
   that on our page as well in the same place on the page. We changed 
   the contents of this top navbar a little as well. We had home, 
   ULink, Current Students, Prospective Students, Faculty, Alumni, 
   Parents, Contact Us. We decided to have these because these 
   were the profiles of anyone visiting the site and we wanted 
   them to have a quick and easy way to navigate directly to their page.
