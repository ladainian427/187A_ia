					After we did the competitive analysis, we had to decide how we wanted to present our navigation and the architecture of the site. For the longest time we wanted to have the primary navigation bar horizontally and the submenu appear right underneath when the user hovers over the parent element in the primary navigation menu.</p>
					
					<p>After doing research, we found that having the menu activated on a hover would make it harder to navigate for the users because it would increase the distance the user would have to navigate the mouse. The mouse often hovers over other elements, so if we had hover-activated menus the wrong menus would be activated when the user would try to get to the secondary  menu, so we decided not to have the hover-activated navigation menu.
					
					<p>We had a regular secondary menu that would appear when the user clicked on the parent element. Then we thought if the user was on a page, they would have to scroll back up to navigate to the other pages. Our hardest decision was if we would rather have the submenu horizontally underneath the primary menu or on the left side of the page. We decided that the user would want to visit the subpages without having to scroll up to the main navigation, so to decrease the distance that the user would need to get to the page they're looking for we decided to put the menu on the left of the page.</p>
					
					<p>We also decided to have navigation in the footer to help the users quickly navigate when they had to read through long pages and didnâ€™t want to scroll all the way back to the top to view the menu.
